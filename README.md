# Unfolding sphere size distribution

Here, we implement the recovery of sphere radius histogram in 3d, based on a circular cross-section radius histogram in 2d. The forward transformation (from 3d to 2d) is well-explained in Eq. (3) of , and Eq. (1) of .

The inverse problem is solved by using a simple gradient descent.
